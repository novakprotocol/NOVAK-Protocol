# @novak/sdk — Official NOVAK Protocol SDK (v0.1.0)

The **NOVAK Protocol** is the world’s first deterministic cryptographic
execution-integrity model — enforcing *Proof-Before-Action (PbA)* and producing
verifiable **Hash-Verified Execution Traces (HVET)** and **Execution Identity
Receipts (EIR)**.

This SDK provides reference implementations of NOVAK primitives:

- HVET (full SHA-X suite)
- EIR block generator
- Proof-Before-Action (PbA)
- HARMONEE Safety Gate
- REVELATION / RGAC audit chain
- Canonical timestamping
- Deterministic randomization utilities

The SDK is fully modular, tree-shakeable, and ESM-only.
