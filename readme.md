### A Cryptographic Primitive for Deterministic Execution Integrity

## 📘 Overview

The **NOVAK Protocol** introduces a new cryptographic primitive:  
**Proof-Before-Action (PbA)** — a system may *only* act after providing a cryptographic proof that its rule, data, output, and timestamp are correct.

At the core is the **Hash-Verified Execution Trace (HVET)**, which binds:

- Rule (R)  
- Data (d)  
- Output (o)  
- Timestamp (t)

into a single cryptographically unforgeable structure.

This establishes **Execution Integrity** — a new field distinct from blockchain, attestations, TPMs, or secure logs.
